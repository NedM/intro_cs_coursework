<p>
	<a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> is a widely-adopted Java unit testing library, and we will use 
	it heavily in 6.005. A major component of the 6.005 design philosophy is to
	decompose problems into minimal, orthogonal units, which can be assembled 
	into the larger modules that form the finished program. One benefit of this
	approach is that each unit can be tested thoroughly, independently of others, 
	so that faults can be quickly isolated and corrected, as code is rewritten and modules 
	are configured. Unit testing is the technique of writing tests for the smallest
	testable pieces of functionality, to allow for the flexible and organic evolution of
	complex, correct systems.
</p>
<p>
	By writing thoughtful unit tests, it is possible to verify the correctness of 
	one's code, and to be confident that the resulting programs behave as expected. In this
	lab, you will learn the basic vocabulary of JUnit, how to run existing tests, and
	how to write new ones. In 6.005, we will use JUnit version 4.
</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of JUnit</h3>

<p>
	JUnit unit tests are written method by method. There is nothing special a class has to do
	to be used by JUnit; it only need contain methods that JUnit knows to call, which will
	be referred to as test methods for the remainder of the lab. Test methods are specified
	entirely through <em>annotations</em>, which may be thought of as keywords (more 
	specifically, they are a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>), 
	that can be attached to individual methods and classes. Though they do not themselves change
	the meaning of a Java program, at run-time other Java code can detect the annotations of
	methods and classes, and make decisions accordingly. The Java annotation system, judiciously
	used, can create dynamic and powerful code. Though we will not deeply explore 
	annotations in 6.005, you will see how other libraries, such as JUnit, make effective 
	use of them.
</p>

<p>
	In the <tt>test</tt> package, you will find a pair of files, <tt>FibonacciGenerator.java</tt>, 
	and <tt>FibonacciTest.java</tt>. <tt>FibonacciGenerator.java</tt> contains the implementation
	for a class that is a bidirectional generator of Fibonacci numbers. The <tt>FibonacciGenerator</tt>
	and the <tt>FibonacciTest</tt> classes are written to be used in an object oriented style.
	That is, a <tt>FibonacciGenerator</tt> is an object that maintains state in its fields (<tt>first</tt> 
	and <tt>second</tt>), that can only be operated on by the methods exposed through the class 
	(<tt>next</tt> and <tt>previous</tt>). <tt>FibonacciTest</tt> is written similarly, though
	it is intended to be used in a specific way, by the JUnit library.
</p>

<p>
	Look closely at <tt>FibonacciTest.java</tt>, and note the <tt>@Before</tt>,
	<tt>@Test</tt>, and <tt>@After</tt> symbols, that precede method definitions. These are
	examples of annotations. The JUnit library uses these particular annotations to
	determine which methods to call when running unit tests. The <tt>@Test</tt> 
	annotation denotes a test method; there can be any number in a single 
	class. Even if one test method fails, the others will be run. The two test methods are very different. The
	<tt>generateAndCheck</tt> method contains calls to <tt>assertEquals</tt>, which is an
	assertion that compares two objects against each other and fails if they are not equal.
	<a href="http://www.junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/Assert.html">Here is a list of 
	the other assertions supported by JUnit</a>. If an assertion in a test method fails, that test method 
	returns immediately, and JUnit records a failure for that test.
</p>

<p>
	The other test method, <tt>callIllegalPrevious</tt>, operates very differently, as 
	it contains no assertions itself. Instead, the assertion is contained within the 
	annotation itself! What the annotation expresses is that running the 
	<tt>callIllegalPrevious</tt> method should result in an uncaught 
	<tt>IllegalStateException</tt> being thrown. If you look at the <tt>previous()</tt>
	method in <tt>FibonacciGenerator.java</tt>, you can see how  the exception can be 
	thrown. For the <tt>callIllegalPrevious</tt> test method to succeed, that line must
	be executed.
</p>

<p>
	The final two annotations, <tt>@Before</tt> and <tt>@After</tt>, are easier to
	explain. Each denotes a method that is called either before or after, 
	respectively, each test method is called. <tt>@Before</tt> methods are a good
	way to share common setup code betweeen multiple tests. <tt>@After</tt> 
	methods can ensure that cleanup code runs, even if a test fails. For example,
	if you are testing code that writes to a temporary files on disk, you may
	want to ensure that the temporary files are deleted whether or not the tests fail.
</p>

<h3>Running Existing Tests</h3>

<p>
	To run the tests in <tt>FibonacciTest</tt>, simply right click on the 
	<tt>FibonacciTest.java</tt> file in either your Package Explorer or Navigator view, 
	and mouse-over the 'Run As' option. Click on the 'JUnit Test' option, and you should 
	see the JUnit view appear, with a green bar indicating that all test methods ran successfully. 
</p>

<div style="float:right; margin-left:1em">
	<a href="img/JunitFail.jpeg"><img src="img/JunitFail.jpeg" style="border:none" width="207" height="268"/></a>
</div>
	
<p>
        To see what a test failure looks like, try changing the initial value of <tt>first</tt> in <tt>FibonacciGenerator</tt> to something outrageous (like 42), then rerun the tests. You should now
	see a red bar in the JUnit view, and if you click on <tt>generateAndCheck</tt>, you will see a stack trace in the 
	bottom box, which provides a brief explanation of what went wrong. 
	In this case, it expected the first value of the generator to be 0, but it was actually 42 (or whatever value you chose).
	Double clicking on lines in the Failure Trace will bring up the code for the test that failed.
</p>

<p>
	For a more thorough introduction, O'Reilly has a 
	<a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/02/04/juie.html"> JUnit and Eclipse
	tutorial</a>, with screen-shots to help you get acquainted with using JUnit from
	within Eclipse. The guide was written for JUnit 3, so the code samples
	use the older (but still supported) JUnit API.
</p>

<p>
	Later in the lab, you'll write some unit tests of your own.

<li><b>Before You Begin</b><br />
<p>Create a file named <tt>oop_answers.txt</tt> under the oop_java folder
(in the same directory as <tt>assignment.html</tt>).
Add it to the SVN repository (right-click on the file &rarr; Team &rarr; Add to Version Control) 
and put your answers to the questions
in this section there.</p>

<p />
<li><b>Warm-up: Light it up</b><br />
<p>Readings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(required)</b> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html">Classes</a> (through "Passing Information to a Method or a Constructor")</li>
<li><b>(required)</b> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/more.html">More on Classes</a> (through "Summary of Creating and Using Classes and Objects")</li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html">Lesson: Classes and Objects</a></li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/java/tij/tij0037.shtml#Heading79">The static keyword</a></li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/java/tij/tij0071.shtml">The final keyword</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Java is an object oriented language. As such, Java programs are made up
of classes. Each class has its own <tt>.java</tt> file with the same name.</p>

<p>Take a look at <tt>Light.java</tt>. Note that it contains a single class
named Light, which represents a simple light that can be on or off.</p>

<p>Its structure is:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
public class Light {
    // Some fields
     
    // Some Constructors
     
    // Some Methods
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The first line is the class declaration and gives the visibility
of the class, the keyword <tt>class</tt>, and the name of the class.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What changes would you have to make in order to rename
the Light class to ShinyLight?</p>

<p>Just inside the class declaration are the field declarations. Fields are the 
variables that the class keeps track of.</p>

<p>They tend to look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
  private <i>typeName</i> <i>variableName</i>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can put certain keywords between the visibility and the typeName
that change the field's behavior. For example, the keyword <tt>final</tt>
indicates that the field's value cannot be changed (with certain
caveats if the value is a mutable Object). The keyword <tt>static</tt> 
turns the field into a class variable.</p>

<p>Since static fields are not tied to a particular instance, you can
access them through <tt><i>Classname.fieldName</i></tt>. An example
of this is the <tt>Math.PI</tt> and <tt>Math.E</tt> fields.
Creating static final fields are a useful way to declare constants.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What would happen if we changed Light's isOn field
to be static and final?</p>

<p>A class's constructors are methods that are used to make a new instance
of a class. <tt>Light</tt> has two different constructors. A constructor
can access other constructors in the current class with the method <tt>this()</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What happens when the no-argument constructor, <tt>Light()</tt> is called?</p>

<p>Methods are the operations provided by a class. They tend to look like:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
  public <i>returnType</i> <i>methodName</i> ( <i>arg1Type</i> <i>arg1Name</i>, <i>arg2Type</i> <i>arg2Name</i>, <i>...</i> ) {
       // body of method
  }

</pre></div>

<p>Methods can also have keywords between their visibility and returnType. Adding the keyword <tt>static</tt> 
to a method indicates that the method is not associated with a particular instance of the class.
An example of this is <tt>Math.max(a, b)</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Question: </b>Why can't static methods directly access non-static fields?</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Fix the problems in <tt>Light.java</tt>. We have included a JUnit test called 
<tt>LightTest.java</tt> to help with this. You can run this unit test the same way you ran the Fibonacci test, by right-clicking on 
<tt>LightTest.java</tt> in Packge Explorer 
or Navigator, then mousing-over 'Run As', then clicking on 'JUnit Test'.
If you are using Eclipse and are paying attention to its warnings,
you should be able to find at least one of the bugs without referring to the JUnit results.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>A light of a different color</b>
<p>Readings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(required)</b> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html">Inheritance</a> (through "Using the Keyword super")</li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/package/usepkgs.html">Using Package Members</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now take a look at <tt>ColoredLight.java</tt>. A <tt>ColoredLight</tt> is simply a <tt>Light</tt>
that also has a <tt>Color</tt>. We use the <tt>extends</tt>
keyword followed by <tt>Light</tt> in the method declaration to indicate that ColoredLight inherits 
from (is a subclass of) Light.
We also import <tt>java.awt.Color</tt> for our color property.</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Implement the constructor and methods for <tt>ColoredLight</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that the method <tt>ColoredLight.randomChange()</tt> overrides the parent's method
<tt>Light.randomChange()</tt>. However, a <tt>ColoredLight</tt> can still access its parent's
version of the method by calling <tt>super.randomChange()</tt>. A subclass's constructor can access
a parent's constructor the same way. For example, in <tt>ColoredLight</tt>'s constructors, one could call
<tt>super()</tt> or <tt>super(<i>boolean</i>)</tt> in order to access <tt>Light</tt>'s constructors.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> How might <tt>ColoredLight</tt>'s constructor have to change if the no-argument <tt>Light()</tt> constructor was
not defined? If you are unsure, try deleting that first constructor in <tt>Light.java</tt> and see what
errors come up in <tt>ColoredLight.java</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Create a JUnit test for <tt>ColoredLight</tt> named <tt>ColoredLightTest</tt>. Use
<tt>LightTest.java</tt> as a model. (To start the file, you can right-click on "lights" and select 
New &rarr; Class.)</p>
</li>

<li><b>All in a row</b>
<p>Readings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(required)</b> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html">What is an interface?</a></li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">Interfaces</a> (whole subsection through "Summary of Interfaces")</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now going to string some lights together to make light patterns. To do this we are going to define
an interface, <tt>HolidayLights</tt>. This interface specifies that anything that implements it will have
a method that will return a sequence of lights representing how the lights will look at the next timeslice (<tt>nextLightSequence()</tt>).</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What's the difference between an interface and a class?</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> When might you use an interface instead of a class (that can then be subclassed)?</p>

<p>The return type for <tt>nextLightSequence()</tt> is <tt>List&lt;Light&gt;</tt>. This is an example of using 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">generics</a>, a very useful Java
language feature. In our case, it specifies that <tt>nextLightSequence()</tt> must return a <tt>List</tt> that only contains
<tt>Light</tt>s.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Running along now</b>
<p>Readings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(required)</b> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/IandI/usinginterface.html">Implementing an Interface</a></li>
<li><b>(required)</b> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/objectcreation.html">Creating Objects</a></li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList javadocs</a></li>
<li>(optional) <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html">The <tt>for</tt> Statement</a> (section about enhanced <tt>for</tt> loops)</li>

</ul>

<p>Now we're going to create a class that implements the <tt>HolidayLights</tt> interface.
<tt>RunningHolidayLights</tt> is a fixed-length string of lights with exactly one light on
at a time. The index of the light that is on will increase until it hits the end of the string
and then start over from the front again.
</p>

<p>As a result, <tt>RunningHolidayLights.nextLightSequence()</tt> should generate a series of light sequences,
all of fixed-length <tt>n</tt>. The first sequence it generates should have the first light on
and all the rest off. The second sequence would have the second light on, and the rest off, and so on.
</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Implement the <tt>nextLightSequence()</tt> method in <tt>RunningHolidayLights</tt>. Also create
<tt>RunningHolidayLightsTest.java</tt> to test your implementation. Make sure to test
the constructor as well as all the methods.</p>

<p>Instead of using a Java array, you should take advantage of Java's <tt>ArrayList</tt> class which implements 
the <tt>List</tt> interface.  The line:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
List&lt;Light&gt; lightList = new ArrayList&lt;Light&gt;();
</pre>
</div>

<p>creates a new <tt>ArrayList&lt;Light&gt;</tt>. Note that you must
import the <tt>ArrayList</tt> class in order to use this. To do so, add</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
import java.util.ArrayList;
</pre>
</div>
<p>to the top of your file, after the <tt>package lights;</tt> declaration. In Eclipse,
you can also hit <b>CTRL-SHIFT-O</b> to automatically <b>O</b>rganize your imports. Eclipse will then
attempt to figure out what class(es) you mean to import and add them for you. If
the name of the class that needs to be imported is ambiguous &mdash; for example, 
there is a <tt>java.util.List</tt> and a <tt>java.awt.List</tt> &mdash; then Eclipse will
prompt you to choose one to import.</p>

<p><tt>HolidayLightsWindow</tt> is a class we're providing that will give a visual
representation of anything that implements <tt>HolidayLights</tt>. 
You should not have to edit any of the code. <tt>Main</tt>
creates some <tt>RunningHolidayLights</tt> of length 12, puts them in a <tt>HolidayLightsWindow</tt>,
and makes the window visible.
</p>

<p>After you have finished implementing and testing <tt>RunningHolidayLights</tt>, run 
<tt>Main.java</tt> as a Java application 
(right-click on the file, go to "Run As" and then "Java Application") to
see the lights!</p> 
</li>

<li>(Optional) <b>Lights of your very own</b>
<p>Create a new class <tt>MyHolidayLights</tt>, which implements <tt>HolidayLights</tt>
but displays a different pattern than <tt>RunningHolidayLights</tt>.</p>

<p>To start you off, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <tt>randomChange</tt>.</li>
<li>Have multiple running lights.</li>
<li>Have blinking lights.</li>
<li>Have lights run from both ends.</li>
<li>Use colored lights.</li>
<li>Periodically change how the lights behave.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to think of what internal variables it needs to store and any convenience methods 
it might want to have.</p>

<p>You should also create corresponding <tt>MyHolidayLightsTests</tt>.</p>

<p>Afterwards, change the first line in <tt>Main.java</tt>'s main method
to instantiate a <tt>MyHolidayLights</tt> instead of a <tt>RunningHolidayLights</tt>.
Since <tt>HolidayLightsWindow</tt> only depends on the <tt>HolidayLights</tt> interface, 
it should be able to display your new class.</p>

Add it to the SVN repository and put your answers to the questions
in this section there.</p>

<p>
Now take a look at the <tt>grades</tt> package.
</p>

<p>
<tt>LetterGrade</tt> is an enumeration of all the letter grades one can get.
</p>

<p>
<tt>InvalidGradeException</tt> is a <i>checked</i> exception that should be thrown if
something that cannot become a valid grade is passed in where one is expected.
</p>

<p>
The heart of the program lies in <tt>GradeManager</tt>. Uncomment the <tt>main</tt> 
method. In Eclipse, you can do this by selecting the relevant lines and then 
typing <b>CTRL /</b>
(or clicking <b>Source->Toggle Comment</b> in the menubar) to comment/uncomment the 
selected lines.</p>

<p><tt>GradeManager</tt>'s main method starts a loop
that reads in input from <tt>System.in</tt> and does some action corresponding to that input.
You can access <tt>System.in</tt> through the Console tab in Eclipse. (In the Java perspective,
this tab is usually grouped with the Problems, Javadoc, and Declaration tabs below the code window.)
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Fix and finish implementing <tt>GradeManager.main</tt>. You should use a
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/try.html">try/catch block</a>.</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Implement <tt>GradeManager.addGrade</tt>. Do this <i>without</i>
using a try/catch block.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Currently <tt>GradeManager.printHistogram</tt> throws an exception
but does not need to declare it in its method signature. Why not?</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Finish implementing <tt>GradeManager</tt>. Run it as a Java Application
to see it at work.</p>

<p><b>Optional Exercise:</b> Write some JUnit tests for <tt>GradeManager</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Optional Exercise:</b> Add the capability for <tt>GradeManager</tt> to load and save grades.</p>
