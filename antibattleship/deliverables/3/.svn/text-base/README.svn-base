README

To run our GUI, please run the main method of the LaunchGUI class in the test package (src/test/).
 
To play 100 games between our AI and the ref player (where our AI is initiating), run the main method of the TestJasperVsRef class in the same package.

Finally, to play a game between our AI and another player (whether our AI is initiating or receiving), run the main method of the TournamentMain class.
Note that you must provide arguments to this method, as used in the tournament and as explained on Stellar.

To run our ABSMessage component tests, run ABSTest.java in the Test package as a JUnit test class

No other part of our code has a main method, but feel free to look around!
